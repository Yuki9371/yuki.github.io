# Hi!

My name is Yiwei Sun, and I also go by Yuki. I am a junior majoring in Computer Science with a solid foundation in C++ and a passion for solving complex problems.
I am interested in a range of topics, including aritificial intelligence, algorithms, databases, and game development. I've been actively studying C++ and applying it to projects. My passion for coding has inspired me to delve into web development, where I've been actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. While I'm still honing my skills in this area, I'm excited about the progress I've made and the potential to integrate my technical expertise with my other skills.

Besides coding, I enjoy reading, painting, playing badminton, and gaming. I'm into pixel art, having dabbled in some creations, and as you can see, the orange sprite favicon on my website is my own design. I'm always eager to try new things, whether it's diving into a new programming language, or challenging myself by developing personal projects.
